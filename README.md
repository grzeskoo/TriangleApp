# TriangleApp

Application for identifying the type of triangle.

A consol application that, based on the given side length, recognizes what kind of triangle will be created.

## Demo

Start the console application and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Tests

Logic written to allow easy testing by creating mocks of interfaces.

One test has been created for the TriangleAppRunner class, although many different test scenarios covering all possible options can be added here.

The TriangleTypeServiceTests class covers the main logic of the application - triangle type recognition.
